  description: 'Andres has found himself in Manila, 1899.


    Tall stone buildings
    and tracks far far away and then deep dug trenches here and there. Ample number
    of houses to give shelter to most. Times have also been kind for technology here:
    jeeps, planes, and radios.


    Despite that, the air is tinted in gray. Not
    to be confused with metaphors of gloominess, but grayness due stress. Stress
    caused by gun powder.
