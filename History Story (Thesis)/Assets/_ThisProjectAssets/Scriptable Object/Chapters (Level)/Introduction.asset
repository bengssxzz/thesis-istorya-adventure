  description: "In the wonderful Wizard World, where magical creatures frolic among
    fabric immaterial, where the moon dictates day and night as it crawls upon trees
    linked to the void, nothing is impossible.\r\n\nOn this fleeting landscape, one
    resident is the Professor, who tinkers with dangerous tech, most of which is
    experimental, all in the name of understanding the world. Though no one doubts
    his expertise and craftsmanship, one must wonder how his apprentice, Andres,
    is still alive.\r\n\nOn one faithful day, Andres, protagonist or hero, was on
    a mission to visit the Professor in the Dark Forest. Andres knew the place well:
    Trees harbor darkness, its creatures always on the move to stay in the light,
    or else they disappear.\r"
