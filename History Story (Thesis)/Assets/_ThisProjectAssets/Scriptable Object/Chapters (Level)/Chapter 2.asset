  description: "After the tides had settled and the wind guided Andres, soil and
    lush green grass fell his face. Waking up grounded to reality, he saw people
    in familiar attires as if they all belong in one group, fortunately they claim
    he was one of them otherwise he'd be running off into new patches of trees. Who
    are these people anyway?\r\n\nThey seem alarmed not to you, but to something
    else. Among the frantic crowd, one man leads them, and beside him an old woman
    who overlooks all of them. \n\nHence, Andres once braces himself again to move
    on with the times he is trapped in.\r People nearby have bolos. Be careful not
    to be felled, from enemies or allies.\r"
