  description: 'Voices are heard far away. Not the magical ones, but voices through
    megaphones, voices spoken firmly and of justified tone.


    The surface Andres
    sat on is hard and concrete, but he took his time to rest after his last trip
    of time, and yet all of these are cut short after seeing people go beyond a pavement.


    Tall
    buildings, but not destroyed and imposing as those he last saw. Everything seems
    fine.


    Curious, rarely once casting aside longing for home, Andres seeks
    to see what all the people are up to.
