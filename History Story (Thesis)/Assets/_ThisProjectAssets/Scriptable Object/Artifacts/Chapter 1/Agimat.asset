  description: "An amulet or charm believed to have protective or magical properties.
    During the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines, which lasted for more
    than 300 years, the indigenous beliefs and practices of the Filipino people were
    influenced and, in some cases, syncretized with Catholicism brought by the Spanish
    colonizers.\r"
